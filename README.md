# My portofolio made with Vue & FastAPI

You will find here the code source of my Portofolio.

## Why those languages?

Well, I could have tried coding in a language I'm comfortable with (like C# with ASP.NET), but the aim here was to learn new web technologies.

## How it is going?

It is going.

## What I learned?

Python is the snake that bite Adam. 

For someone who likes more low level languages, I'm not a fan of not being able to have a hand on every line of your code. Typing is absent, and that's something I really don't like. But as we say, the best solution is not always the best solution. 

For requesting Github to get some informations of my profil, FastAPI was accurate and very suitable for the job.

As for Vue, I'm a big fan, nothing more to say.
