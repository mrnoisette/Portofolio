# My portofolio made with Vue & FastAPI

You will find here the code source of my Portofolio.

## Why those languages?

Indeed, I could have tried to code with a language wich I am confortable with (such as C# with ASP.NET) but the goal here was to learn some new web technologies.

## How it is going?

It is going.

## What I learned?

That Python is the snake that bite Adam. 

More seriously, it is stunning to see how easily it is to fastly code things (which is quite weird to handle for someone you like more low level languages). Because I am not fan of not being able the have the hand on each line of your code. The typage is missing, and this is something that I really don't like.

But as we say, the best solution is not always the best solution. 

For requesting Github to get some informations of my profil, FastAPI was accurate and fit verry well for this job.

Concerning Vue, I am a big fan, nothing to say more.
