# My portofolio made with Vue & FastAPI

In the goal to familiarise myself to web technologies, I'm currently trying to develop my own Portofolio website with VueJS for the front, and FastAPI for the back.

Please note that I am new to Python and JS language. I am more specialized in software developpemnt (such as .Net stack).

## Why those languages?

Indeed, I could have tried to code with a language wich I am confortable with (such as C# with ASP.NET) but the goal here was to learn some new web technologies.

##Â How it is going?

Next question please.
